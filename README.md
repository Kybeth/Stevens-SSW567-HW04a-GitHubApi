My thoughts:

- I'm trying to use TDD this time, to use the Red-Green-Refactor cycle. But it's really hard to write all the test before you write code. It just feels weird. 
- Also, to write enough tests, I have to analysis the data in advance, to know what I would get as a result. 
- Besides, the efficient use of *unittest* is not as easy as I thought.
